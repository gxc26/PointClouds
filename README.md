# PointClouds
Study of 3D computer Vision using deep learning on PointClouds representation.  

When running the JupyterNoteBook project, please make sure to setup the needed Python environment.   I have included a backup of the Anaconda Navigator environment (“PyClouds.yaml”) that I used with the notebook.
